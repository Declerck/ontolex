# This example illustrates how to specify the canonical form of different types of lexical entries, e.g. for a noun (cat), verb (marry) and adjective (high)

:lex_cat a ontolex:LexicalEntry;
     ontolex:canonicalForm :form_cat;
     ontolex:writtenRep "cat"@en .

:lex_marry a ontolex:LexicalEntry;
     ontolex:canonicalForm :form_marry;
     ontolex:writtenRep "marry"@en .

:lex_high a ontolex:LexicalEntry;
     ontolex:canonicalForm :form_high;
     ontolex:writtenRep "high"@en .

# And here we give one example for a multiword expression (MWE)

:lex_intangible_assets a ontolex:LexicalEntry;
     ontolex:canonicalForm :form_intangible_assets;
     ontolex:writtenRep "intangible assets"@en .
